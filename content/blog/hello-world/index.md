description: Is it too late?
---

Hi! This is my first blog post.

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

For now, let me just settle in with this quote from [a blog post](https://robertgreiner.com/later-equals-never/) I've recently encountered:
> Later never comes, do the work now and have something to show for your efforts.

It's a blog post about software developers' common misunderstanding of "later" and how the work never gets done when they think they will do it later.

However, I think this applies to most of the things in life as well. Because whenever you think you'll do or accomplish something in your life, but never act for it, it eventually becomes "too late".

So, I guess in order to be happy with most of the things you're doing with your life, it's very important to find the right balance between these four sentences:


"I'll do it later." <-> "Later never comes."

"It's too late." <-> "It's never too late."

Let's do things now.
